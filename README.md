# Two-Dimensional Array

### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding two-dimensional arrays, declaring them, accessing their elements using indexes, and performing operations on them.

### Problem
Create a 2D array called `values` with 2x3 dimensions of type `float`.

### Implementation
- Create an array of `values` with 2x3 dimensions.
- Initialize the array with default values (0.0 for each element).
- Print the number of rows and columns using the length attribute.
- Print the array.
- Choose and update a value in the array.
- Print the array after updating it.
  
``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
```
