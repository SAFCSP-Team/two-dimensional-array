# Two Dimensional Array

### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding two dimensional array, declaring them, accessing their elements using indexes, and performing operations on them.

### Problem
Create a 2D array called `values` with dimensions 10x1 of type **float**.

### Implementation
- Create an array `values` with dimensions 10x1.
- Initialize the array with default values (0.0 for each element).
- Print the array.
- Update the value of the second element to a new float value.
- Print the array after updating it.
